# 7daysmods

This project contains modifications made by Lilac and Michael for use in the game 7 Days to Die.
These folders should be put in the folder 7 Days to Die/mods

The stat changes move around skills and add non-combat benefits to investing in each skill


## Stat Overhaul Mod
**Gives new passive abilities to each stat:**
- Fortitude: debuff resistance (bleed, burn, shocked/stun, and infection)
- Strength: Pack Mule
- Intellect: Scrapper
- Perception: Lucky Looter + Treasure Hunter (combined)
- Agility:  Attack/Reload speed (all weapons)

**Skill Removals + Merges**
- Removed Pack Mule, Scrapper, Lucky Looter, Treasure Hunter, and all weapon-specific speed skills, since these are all now granted by virtue of investing in a stat.
- Merged Clubs, Sledghammers, and Brawler weapon-specific skills
- Merged Parkour and Run and Gun

**Moved Skills**
- Lockpicking (Int) and Huntsman (Fortitude) are moved into Agility
- Daring Adventurer (Int) and Charismatic Nature (Int) into Foritude
- Demolitions Expert (Strength) and Master Chef (Strength) into Intellect
- Archery (Agility), Gunslinger (Agility), Boom Stick (Strength), Living off the Land (Foritude) into Perception
- Spear Master (Perception) and Machine Gunner (Fortitude) into Strength. The merged blunt weapon skills (fist, club, sledgehammers) are all under Strength.

**New Skills**
- Fortitude: Skill that increases Max Health
- Perception: Skill that increases Ranged weapons' chance to slow This may overlap with some of the new magazines, so we might change this.
- Perception: Skill that increases Ranged weapons' headshot damage. This may overlap with some of the new magazines, so we might change this.
- Strength: Skill that increases Melee weapons' chance to dismember
- Strength: Skill that increases Melee weapons' damage
- Strength: Skill that increases Max Stamina

**Why?**
We wanted multi-stat builds to feel fun and wanted to allow more diverse/interesting builds. We viewed Perception, Agility, and Strength as more action-focused and Fortitude + Intellect as more supportive. Just as a note, we consider Fortitude similar to "will" or "resolve".
